# How to use
First, instanciate a Debouncer class.<pr>
Notice: it is not a singletton so you have the option to create multiple instances of deboncer each one of them with one logic.
```dart
final Debouncer debouncer = Debouncer();
```

Then, in any place, use it. 
```dart
TextFormField(
  ...
  onChanged: (final String text) {
    decouncer.resetDebounce(() {
      // Do something with the text
    });
  },
),
```

# Don't forget to dispose the debounce timer after using it
```dart
debouncer.dispose();
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Calling dispose `is not mandatory`. But if you don't dispose it the function will be executed even if you are not more in the context where it has been placed. So if, for example, the function inside the debouncer uses a dependencies that dosen't exist any more you will get an error. This will basically cancel the debounce timer and execution.

# Other helpfull functions

### Add a function that will be executed before debounce execute function
You can add how many functions you want. They will run in the order they where added.
```dart
debouncer.addOnInitFunction(() {
    print('start 1');
});
debouncer.addOnInitFunction(() {
    print('start 2');
});
```

### Add a function that will be executed after debounce execute function
You can add how many functions you want. They will run in the order they where added.
```dart
debouncer.addOnEndFunction(() {
    print('end 1');
});
debouncer.addOnEndFunction(() {
    print('end 2');
});
```

### Change debounce duration
```dart
// The debouncer time is 1 sec
final debouncer = Debouncer(timerDuration: Duration(seconds: 1));

// Now the timer is 3 secs
debounder.updateTimer(Duration(seconds: 3));
``` 
### Duration extensions 
Extension methods for num, to make specifying durations easier. For example: 2.seconds, 0.1.minutes, or 300.ms.
